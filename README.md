## **Assignment Title:**
**Building a Resilient Digital Future: Proposing Legal Reforms for Cyber Law in Bangladesh Based on Leading Global Examples**
---

### **1. Introduction**

The digital transformation of Bangladesh has brought about significant advancements in governance, commerce, education, and healthcare. However, it also exposes the nation to growing cyber threats such as hacking, identity theft, misinformation, and data breaches. Current cyber laws, primarily governed by the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Act 2006 and the Digital Security Act 2018, are widely criticized for their vague definitions, limited scope, and potential misuse. These limitations pose challenges to building a secure and rights-based digital ecosystem.

This assignment aims to propose comprehensive legal reforms for Bangladesh's cyber laws by drawing on successful practices from global pioneers such as Estonia, the European Union (GDPR), and the United States. It also introduces a structured victim support system to protect citizens and ensure justice.

### **2. Objectives of the Study**

* To evaluate the current cyber law framework in Bangladesh.
* To identify global best practices in cyber law and digital rights protection.
* To recommend legal reforms to address gaps in current legislation.
* To propose a victim support framework to assist individuals affected by cybercrime.
